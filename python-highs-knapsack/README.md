# Nextmv Python HiGHS Knapsack

Example for running a Python application on the Nextmv Platform using the HiGHS
solver. We solve a knapsack Mixed Integer Programming problem.

1. Install packages.

   * With `pip`

      ```bash
      pip install .
      ```

   * With `uv`
  
      ```bash
      uv sync
      ```

2. Run the app.

   * With `python`

      ```bash
      cat input.json | python main.py
      ```

   * With `uv`

      ```bash
      cat input.json | uv run main.py
      ```

      Or with custom options:

      ```bash
      cat input.json | uv run main.py -duration 30
      ```

Alternatively, you may reference the `main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook which, in
addition to running locally, showcases how to push the app and run it remotely.

## Next steps

* Open `main.py` and modify the model.
