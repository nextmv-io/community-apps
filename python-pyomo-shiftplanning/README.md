# Nextmv Python Pyomo Shift Planning

Example for running a Python application on the Nextmv Platform using the Pyomo
solver interface. We solve a shift planning Mixed Integer Programming
problem.

Pyomo [does not include any solvers][pyomo-solvers]. Install solvers locally or
run remotely using Nextmv Cloud.

1. Install packages.

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the app.

    ```bash
    python3 main.py -input input.json -output output.json \
      -duration 30 -provider cbc
    ```

## Mirror running on Nextmv Cloud locally

Docker needs to be installed.

To run the application in the same Docker image as the one used on Nextmv
Cloud, you can use the following command:

```bash
cat input.json | docker run -i --rm \
-v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/nextmv-io/runtime/pyomo:latest \
sh -c 'python3 /app/main.py'
```

You can also debug the application by running it in a Dev Container. This
workspace recommends to install the Dev Container extension for VSCode. If you
have the extension installed, you can open the workspace in a container by
using the command `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
