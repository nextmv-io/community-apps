# Nextmv Python Hexaly Knapsack

Example for running a Python application on the Nextmv Platform using the
Hexaly solver. We solve a knapsack Mixed Integer Programming problem.

If you have a Hexaly license, remove the `.template` extension from the
`license.dat.template` file and replace the contents with your actual license
key. Modify the `app.yaml` file to include the `license.dat` in the files list.

1. Install packages.

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the app.

    ```bash
    python3 main.py -input input.json -output output.json -duration 30
    ```

## Mirror running on Nextmv Cloud locally

Docker needs to be installed.

To run the application in the same Docker image as the one used on Nextmv
Cloud, you can use the following command:

```bash
cat input.json | docker run -i --rm \
-v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/nextmv-io/runtime/hexaly:latest \
sh -c 'python3 /app/main.py'
```

You can also debug the application by running it in a Dev Container. This
workspace recommends to install the Dev Container extension for VSCode. If you
have the extension installed, you can open the workspace in a container by
using the command `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
