# Nextmv community apps

Pre-built decision apps serving as the base for [Marketplace subscription
apps][subscription-apps]. Each app is standalone and can be executed following
the instructions in each `README`.

## Hello world

Get started with one of the following apps:

* [go-hello-world]: Get started with Go and the Nextmv Platform.
* [java-hello-world]: Get started with Java and the Nextmv Platform.
* [python-hello-world]: Get started with Python and the Nextmv Platform.

## More apps

These examples are concrete cases of using different languages and solvers in
decision apps that run on the Nextmv Platform.

## Other, more complex, examples

Use devcontainers to run the app on Docker like it would be run on Nextmv
Cloud.

* [python-pyomo-knapsack]: Use Python and Pyomo to solve a knapsack problem.
* [java-ortools-knapsack]: Use Java and OR-Tools to solve a knapsack problem.
* [go-nextroute]: Solve a Vehicle Routing Problem using `nextroute`.

Before starting:

1. [Sign up][signup] for a Nextmv account.
2. [Install][installation] the Nextmv Platform.
